Minesweeper Game

A Python-based GUI implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using the tkinter library. This project is designed for both beginners and advanced programmers to explore interactive GUI development and logic-based gameplay.

Features

Classic Minesweeper Gameplay: Navigate through a grid, avoiding hidden mines while uncovering cells.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built with the tkinter library for an intuitive and interactive experience.

Timer: Tracks the time spent on each game.

Restart Button: Restart the game at any point with a single click.

Flagging System: Right-click to flag potential mines.

Game Results: Displays whether you win or lose, with mines visually marked on the board.

Result Saving: Saves the game board and moves to a text file for review.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minesweeper.git
cd minesweeper

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

Install any required dependencies (if needed):

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: tkinter is typically included with Python installations.)

How to Play

Run the script:

python minesweeper.py

A Minesweeper game window will appear with a grid of buttons.

Gameplay:

Left-click to reveal a cell.

Right-click to flag a cell as a potential mine.

The numbers in revealed cells indicate how many neighboring mines exist.

Winning Condition:

Uncover all cells without triggering a mine.

Losing Condition:

Clicking on a mine ends the game.

Restart the game using the "Restart" button.

File Structure

minesweeper.py: The main game logic and GUI code.

result.txt: A text file where game results (board state and moves) are saved.

Future Enhancements

Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Implement a hint system to assist players.

Introduce animations and sound effects for a more engaging experience.

Add a leaderboard to track best times.
